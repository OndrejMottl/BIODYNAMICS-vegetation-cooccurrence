# Note on the input data

The project uses the [VegVault](bit.ly/VegVault) database, which is accessible from the [VegVault](https://bit.ly/VegVault) website.

In order to make the project work, you need to download the VegVault database and place it in the `Data/Input` folder. The database is a SQLite file with the name `VegVault.sqlite`.
