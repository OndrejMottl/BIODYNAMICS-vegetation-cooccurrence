Classify Taxonomic Resolution

Description:

     Classifies taxa in a data frame to a specified taxonomic
     resolution (family, genus, or species) using a classification
     table, and aggregates pollen proportions accordingly.

Usage:

     classify_taxonomic_resolution(
       data,
       data_classification_table,
       taxonomic_resolution
     )
     
Arguments:

    data: A data frame containing taxon data with columns including
          'taxon', 'dataset_name', 'age', and 'pollen_prop'.

data_classification_table: A data frame mapping 'sel_name' to taxonomic
          levels (e.g., family, genus, species).

taxonomic_resolution: A character string specifying the taxonomic
          resolution to classify to. Must be one of 'family', 'genus',
          or 'species'.

Details:

     Performs a left join to map taxa to the desired resolution,
     aggregates pollen proportions, and ensures all
     dataset_name-age-taxon combinations are present in the output.

Value:

     A data frame with taxa classified to the specified resolution and
     pollen proportions aggregated accordingly. The output preserves
     all dataset_name and age combinations for true negatives.
