Make HMSC Model

Description:

     Create a Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC)
     model to fit community and abiotic data.

Usage:

     make_hmsc_model(
       data_to_fit = NULL,
       random_structure = NULL,
       error_family = c("normal", "binomial")
     )
     
Arguments:

data_to_fit: A list containing the community and abiotic data to fit
          the model.

random_structure: A list containing the random structure for the model,
          including the study design and random levels.

error_family: A character string specifying the error family. Options
          are "normal" or "binomial" (default: "normal").

Details:

     If `error_family` is "binomial", the community data is converted
     to binary presence/absence data, and the error family is set to
     "probit".

Value:

     returns an unfitted HMSC model object.
