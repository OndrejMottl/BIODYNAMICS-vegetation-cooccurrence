Get Random Structure for Model

Description:

     Constructs the random structure for HMSC models based on age
     and/or space.

Usage:

     get_random_structure_for_model(
       data = NULL,
       type = c("age", "space"),
       min_knots_distance = NULL
     )
     
Arguments:

    data: A list containing data for model fitting from the function
          [check_and_prepare_data_for_fit()].

    type: Character vector specifying random effect types ("age",
          "space").

min_knots_distance: Minimum distance between knots for spatial random
          effect (optional). Only used if "space" is in `type`.

Value:

     A list describing the random structure for the model.
