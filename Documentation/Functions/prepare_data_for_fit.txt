Prepare Data for Model Fitting

Description:

     Prepares community or abiotic data for model fitting by reshaping
     it into a wide format with appropriate column names.

Usage:

     prepare_data_for_fit(data = NULL, type = c("community", "abiotic"))
     
Arguments:

    data: A data frame containing the input data. For `type =
          "community"`, it must include columns `dataset_name`, `age`,
          `taxon`, and `pollen_prop`. For `type = "abiotic"`, it must
          include columns `dataset_name`, `age`,
          `abiotic_variable_name`, and `abiotic_value`.

    type: A character string specifying the type of data to prepare.
          Must be either "community" or "abiotic" (default:
          "community").

Details:

     The function validates the input data and reshapes it based on the
     specified `type`. For community data, it combines `dataset_name`
     and `age` into a `sample_name` column, selects relevant columns,
     and pivots the data to a wide format. For abiotic data, it
     performs similar steps but uses abiotic variable names and values.

Value:

     A data frame in wide format, with `sample_name` as row names and
     either taxa or abiotic variable names as columns. For community
     data, missing values are filled with 0. For abiotic data, missing
     values are left as NA.
