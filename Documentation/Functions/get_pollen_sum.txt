Calculate the Total Pollen Count for Each Sample

Description:

     This function computes the total pollen count for each sample in
     the provided dataset.

Usage:

     get_pollen_sum(data)
     
Arguments:

    data: A data frame containing at least two columns: `sample_name`
          (the name or identifier of the sample) and `pollen_count`
          (the count of pollen for each observation).

Details:

     The function groups the data by `sample_name`, calculates the sum
     of `pollen_count` for each group, and removes any grouping
     structure before returning the result. Missing values (`NA`) in
     `pollen_count` are ignored.

Value:

     A data frame with two columns: `sample_name` and `pollen_sum`,
     where `pollen_sum` is the total pollen count for each sample.
