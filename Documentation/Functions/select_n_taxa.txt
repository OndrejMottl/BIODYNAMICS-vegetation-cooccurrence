Select N Taxa

Description:

     Selects the top N taxa based on their occurrence across datasets.

Usage:

     select_n_taxa(data = NULL, n_taxa = Inf, per = "dataset_name")
     
Arguments:

    data: A data frame containing the input data. Must include columns
          "taxon" and the column specified in the `per` parameter.

  n_taxa: A numeric value specifying the number of taxa to select.
          Default is Inf.

     per: A character string specifying the column name to group by.
          Default is "dataset_name".

Details:

     The function identifies the most common taxa across datasets by
     counting their occurrences. It then filters the input data to
     include only the selected taxa. If no taxa are found, an error is
     raised.

Value:

     A data frame containing the filtered data with the top N taxa.
