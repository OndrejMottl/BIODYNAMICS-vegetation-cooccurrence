# Reproducibility

## {[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)}

This project uses the {renv} package to manage dependencies. To install the required packages, run the following command in the R console:

``` r
renv::restore()
```

This will install all the packages listed in the `renv.lock` file.

Currently, the project is coded as {[targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)} pipeline and can be executed using the following command:

```{r}
#| eval=FALSE
source(
  here::here("R/02_Main_analyses/01_Run_pipeline.R")
)
```
