# BIODYNAMICS - Vegetation Co-occurrence

This is a project to study the co-occurrence of vegetation across space and time.

The repo is part of the [BIODYNAMICS](https://bit.ly/BIODYNAMICS) project.

See [detailed description of the project](/website/about.qmd) for more information.

The latest information are always available on the [project website](/index.qmd).

# Functions

This project is coded in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and uses {[targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)} pipeline to run the analysis. 

## Documentation of individual functions

Each function used in the project is documented using the [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) package. Here we present the list of functions used in the project:

## Code coverage

```{r}

)
```


In order to check issues during the development of the code, we are writing test using the {[testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/)} package. Then we are using the {[covr](https://covr.r-lib.org/)} package to check the code coverage. The code coverage is calculated for each function and the overall code coverage is calculated as well.

Current code coverage is: ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OndrejMottl/BIODYNAMICS-vegetation-cooccurrence/main/Documentation/Functions_test_coverage/covr_report_summary.json&query=$.value&label=codecov&color=orange&style=flat-square&suffix=%25)

The full interactive report of the {[covr](https://covr.r-lib.org/)} package can be found here:
